# Tutorial: Manage your BCDR estate efficiently using Azure Business Continuity Center Copilot

This article describes how to leverage Azure Business Continuity Center Copilot to make your business continuity journey easy.  

## What is Azure Business Continuity Center Copilot? 
Azure Business Continuity Center Copilot assists users in protecting and recovering their resources. Below are the key use cases for the ABCC Copilot MVP, prioritized by the four BCDR pillars: 

1. Protection Management 

1. Ransomware Protection 

1. Monitoring and Reporting 

1. Learn and get help on capabilities.

With Azure Business Continuity Center Copilot (preview), you can ask questions about your Azure resources' protection directly within the Azure portal using natural language. The Copilot retrieves information about your resources and their protection status and guides you through relevant processes.

The following table lists all supported prompts:

| Category | Prompts |
